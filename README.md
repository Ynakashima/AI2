# Frontend Homework Instructions

## Homework Task

Create a standards-compliant web page based on the provided design. This design includes various browser widths as a
guide. For simplicity, we do not expect backward compatibility with older or non-cross platform browsers. You are free
to use the latest web technologies, but take note of the browsers listed in the evaluation section.

The task is to fill out the `/src/index.html` page with styles and Javascript as needed. Anchors are not expected to
link to a particular page. Hover states for links and buttons are included in their own design mock.



## Environment Setup

Along with this `README.md` file, the `homework.zip` file includes the design mocks and assets in the `/designs`
folder. For redlines – pixel values, fonts, and other style specifications – we have setup a Zeplin account with
access to the S2 Homework project. Zeplin is a tool we use for sharing designs which helps with communicating
specifics about a layout from a Designer. Zeplin also includes text and design assets, which might make it faster to
write the HTML.

The `homework.zip` file also contains a `/src` folder where your changes should go. Run `npm start` to start a simple,
static HTTP server. The server will serve files from the `/src` folder, but you can point it at build folder if you
choose. This project was built using Node v8.10.0, but other versions of Node may also work.



## Homework Submission

Once the homework is completed, please create a `.zip` file of the `/src` folder – you can leave out the
`/src/node_modules` folder if you like – and email that to your contact at AI2. It will be reviewed by an engineer on
the team by running the scripts in the `package.json` file.



## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the quality of HTML, CSS, and JS code submitted, as well as your adherence to the spirit of
the provided design. Deviations from the design are welcome, but could become a point of discussion should you move
forward in the interview process. Your submission will be loaded from the static HTTP server running on Node v8.10.0
in the latest version of Chrome and Firefox on the desktop, Safari and Chrome on tablet and mobile. To start the server,
we will run `npm start`.

You will not be evaluated on what libraries you use, and you are encouraged to use whatever makes you most productive.
While you will not be evaluated on the build process for assets, you are free to alter the build steps however you
need to make yourself more efficient.

The Last Question
Isaac Asimov
November 1956 • Science Fiction Quarterly

The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:

Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.

Multivac’s Background

Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.
For decades, Multivac ha d helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.

But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.

The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.
Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.
